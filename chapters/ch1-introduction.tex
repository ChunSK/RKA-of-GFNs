We generalize the provable RKA security of balanced Feistel networks to various
generalized Feistel networks.
These provide new theory tools.
Multi-line GFNs provide domain extender for RKA secure blockciphers, while
condensing and expanding GFNs provide more convenient ways to use the RKA
secure PRFs built upon complexity assumptions (note that such PRFs, e.g., in,
are typically of ``abnormal'' domain and range rather than $\{0,1\}^n$).
