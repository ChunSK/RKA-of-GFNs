\subsection{General Notations and Definitions}

For a finite set $\mathcal{X}$, $X \xleftarrow{\$} \mathcal{X}$ denotes selecting an element from $\mathcal{X}$ uniformly at random and $|\mathcal{X}|$ denotes its cardinality.
In all the following, we fix an integer $n\geq 1$.
% and denote $N=2^n$. 
Further denote by  the set of all
functions of domain $\{0,1\}^*$ and range $\{0,1\}^{2n}$,
by $\permutationset$ the set of all
permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$, and by
$\blockcipherset$ the set of all blockciphers with $n$-bit
block-size and $n$-bit keys. Finally, for $U,X\in\{0,1\}^n$, $U\|X$ or simply $UX$ denotes their concatenation.
