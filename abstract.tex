We examine the related-key security of various generalized Feistel networks, including contracting, expanding, alternating Feistel, and Naor-Reingold construction. In detail,
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assuming using related-key secure round functions, we show that alternating key assignments are sufficient for contracting, expanding, and alternating Feistel networks. We also unveil the nearly optimal round complexities for the schemes that are sufficient for related-key CCA security.
	\item Assuming using related-key secure AXU hashing (introduce by Wang et al., FSE 2016) and round functions, we prove that the Naor-Reingold construction is related-key secure.
\end{itemize}
Our results enable constructing efficient variable input length related-key secure SPRPs for various applications such as non malleable codes and temper resilience.
